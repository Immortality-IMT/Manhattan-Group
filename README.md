Immortality cryptocurrency has a dedicated blockchain project. Immortality cryptocurrency migration to its own blockchain project is code named the Manhattan Group.

We are DeSci, watch a video here... https://youtu.be/-DeMklVWNdA

Along with bankless financial infrastructure, Manhattan Group seeks to fund future technologies with blockchain and crypto. Technologies that unlock technologies, watershed technologies, upstream technologies such as AGI that have far-reaching upgrade potential.

#### Some projects that DeSci should prioritize
- Open source A.I. such as GPT-Neo and GPT-J. Unsantized, uncensored, open source AGI.
- The Big Brain Project - Dish brain projects
- Space Tourism, indestructible human capsule guaranteeing safety
- Cure Aging, live forever, cure cancer, feel good
- Renewable energy, turn the worlds deserts into solar power stations and 100% proof of work from renewables
- More computer power please, manufacture faster personal computers and offer them at great prices

#### How can DeSci work?

```We suggest doubling the miner's block reward and transaction fee to fund deSci. The miner is restricted to donate the extra block reward to watershed technologies. Other methods have been proposed, such as Quadratic Funding.```

```With a virtuous circle agreement, a successful moonshot could injects significant capital into the ecosystem```

If you are interested in being part of the moderation of the project, join and discuss blockchain at our telegram https://t.me/immortality_IMT

The whitepaper is being written at https://imt.cx/blockchain.html

There is no expediency in the production of this blockchain, we shall understand and solve all the problems in the whitepaper before we begin coding.

The project is broken up into separate parts and each are independent of each other. So work on what you want to work on. At release, we shall bring it all together.

Part 1: Node discovery system of the peer to peer network<br />
Part 2: Propagation and latency of information to the peer to peer network<br />
Part 3: Is the blockchain stuff, mining, wallets, crunching numbers...<br />
Part 4: Smart contract platform<br />


From Bitcoin To Eth and Beyond
------------------------------
In Bitcoin, the smart contract is limited to the traditional transaction. Ethereum with smart contracts expands and anything that can be computer programmed lives on blockchain, but it is a mere means to transactions, a mere product for transactions and just a single product for transactions, "the smart contract" and its sales pitch. In thinking abut this and to expand on that further, we can universalize and say, all things that have transaction volume potential. That is, to develop blockchain is with primary goal of transaction volume potential. The user space for anyone to leverage the blockchain however they choose to achieve that transaction volume potential in turn make their product a success. The proof is self-evident, not just smart contracts. Such a blockchain should offer an undefined user space and blockchain development accommodates. Well, more so dictates development direction. We are not selling smart contracts, instead any product the user can bring that has transaction potential, the blockchain needs to host it. The word for this API's, Application Progrmaming Interfaces.
