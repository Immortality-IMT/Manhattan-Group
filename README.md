Immortality cryptocurrency has a dedicated blockchain project. Immortality cryptocurrency migration to its own blockchain project is code named the Manhattan Project.

We are deSci, watch a video on deSci here... https://youtu.be/-DeMklVWNdA

```Make mining profitable again. We suggest doubling the miner's block reward and fund deSci with it. The miner is restricted to donate the extra block reward to watershed technologies. Other methods have been proposed, such as Quadratic Funding.```

deSci seeks to fund future technologies with blockchain and crypto. Technologies that unlock technologies, watershed technologies such as AGI, would cause a universal upgrade.

The whitepaper is being written at https://imt.cx/blockchain.html

There is no expediency in the production of this blockchain, we shall understand and solve all the problems in the whitepaper before we begin coding.
