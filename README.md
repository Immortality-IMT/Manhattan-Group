Immortality cryptocurrency has a dedicated blockchain project. Immortality cryptocurrency migration to its own blockchain project is code named the Manhattan Project.

We are deSci, watch a video on deSci here... https://youtu.be/-DeMklVWNdA

We suggest to double the miner's block reward and fund deSci with it.

deSci wants to fund future technologies with blockchain and crypto.

The whitepaper is being written at https://imt.cx/blockchain.html

There is no expediency in the production of this blockchain, we shall understand and solve all the problems in the whitepaper before we begin coding.
