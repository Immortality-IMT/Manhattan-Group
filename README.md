Immortality cryptocurrency has a dedicated blockchain project. Immortality cryptocurrency migration to its own blockchain project is code named the Manhattan Project.

We are DeSci, watch a video here... https://youtu.be/-DeMklVWNdA

DeSci seeks to fund future technologies with blockchain and crypto. Technologies that unlock technologies, watershed technologies such as AGI, would cause a universal upgrade.

#### Some projects that DeSci should prioritize
- Open source A.I such as GPT-Neo and GPT-J. Unsantized, uncensored, open source AGI.
- The Big Brain Project - Dish brain projects
- Space Tourism
- Cure Aging
- Renewable energy

If you are interested in being part of the moderation of the project, join and discuss blockchain at our telegram https://t.me/immortality_IMT

#### How can DeSci work?

```We suggest doubling the miner's block reward to fund deSci. The miner is restricted to donate the extra block reward to watershed technologies. Other methods have been proposed, such as Quadratic Funding.```

The whitepaper is being written at https://imt.cx/blockchain.html

There is no expediency in the production of this blockchain, we shall understand and solve all the problems in the whitepaper before we begin coding.

Part 2: Propagation and latency of information to the peer to peer network
Part 3: Is the blockchain stuff, mining, wallets, crunching numbers...
